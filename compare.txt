 (A) Women with half-national average CV risk initiating therapy at 50 years. Mean life expectancy gain 3 months, 96.6% gain no extra lifespan, but the remaining 3.4% gain an average of 92 months. (B) Men with double-national average CV risk initiating therapy at 50 years. Mean life expectancy gain 12 months, 88.9% gain no extra lifespan, but the remaining 11.1% gain an average of 107 months. (C) Women with half-national average CV risk initiating therapy at 80 years. Mean life expectancy gain 2.5 months, 96.4% gain no extra lifespan, but the remaining 3.6% gain an average of 70 months. (D) Men with double-national average CV risk initiating therapy at 80 years. Mean life expectancy gain 6 months, 88.5% gain no extra lifespan, but the remaining 11.5% gain an average of 56 months.

lifespandays(start_age_years = 80,baseline_CVD_hazard_ratio = 2,gender="male")
Among  1000   male  with 2 times average risk started on therapy at  80 years of age.The percentage of those benefitting is  10.6  percent,while rest will have zero benefit. The mean overall lifespan gain is 5.78 months. The life span gain in the lucky beneficiaries is 54.5  months.
