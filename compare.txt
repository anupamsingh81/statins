 (A) Women with half-national average CV risk initiating therapy at 50 years. Mean life expectancy gain 3 months, 96.6% gain no extra lifespan, but the remaining 3.4% gain an average of 92 months. (B) Men with double-national average CV risk initiating therapy at 50 years. Mean life expectancy gain 12 months, 88.9% gain no extra lifespan, but the remaining 11.1% gain an average of 107 months. (C) Women with half-national average CV risk initiating therapy at 80 years. Mean life expectancy gain 2.5 months, 96.4% gain no extra lifespan, but the remaining 3.6% gain an average of 70 months. (D) Men with double-national average CV risk initiating therapy at 80 years. Mean life expectancy gain 6 months, 88.5% gain no extra lifespan, but the remaining 11.5% gain an average of 56 months.
